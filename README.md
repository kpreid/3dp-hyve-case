Case for the Hyve Touch Synthesizer, incorporating a 9V battery compartment and mounting hole for a toggle switch.

It is not necessary to modify the Hyve board; there is room for plugging into the stock DC jack.

This case has not been designed for FDM printing; it may work but I haven't tried it and tolerances are very close. Mine was printed with Shapeways "Black Natural Versatile Plastic" which is SLS-printed nylon.

## Assembly and parts

You will need a soldering iron to complete the wiring, and the following parts:

* \#2-28 screws for plastic, lengths 2× 1/4" (for front), and 2× 1/2" (for rear). #3 screws are also okay if you drill out the holes to suit.
* 9V battery snap.
* 5.5 mm × 2.1 mm barrel plug, with outer shell left off.
* Small toggle switch (the hole is 5.81 mm with an anti-rotation tab).
* Wire to run between the switch and plug.
* Rubber feet, if desired.

The battery compartment has no door; just insert some thin cardboard beside the battery to hold it in and keep it from rattling.
